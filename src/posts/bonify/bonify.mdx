      Bonify is an all-in-one app for the people who want to take control of
      their financial lives. The main features include a regularly updated free
      credit score information, financial health score, as well as personalised
      offers for financial products (eg. loans, credit cards, insurance). As an
      extension, the bonify platform also regularly publishes blog articles
      aiming to improve users' knowledge of the financial topics.

  <ColumnHeading>Background</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      Since its launch in 2016, bonify’s design hasn’t changed much. Although a
      basic style guide was defined in the very beginning, as new pages were
      being created and platforms evolved, design solutions were introduced
      quickly and spontaneously. This resulted in a general lack of consistency
      when it came to UX and visual design of different parts of the system.
      <br />
      <br />
      These were: (in order of planned redesign implementation):
      <br />
      <br />– CMS pages (homepage, all the landing pages and content articles written
      and maintained by the Marketing department – WordPress based)
      <br />
      <br />– web app (the main product – responsive React)
      <br />
      <br />– Android and iOS native apps
      <br />
      <br />

  <ColumnHeading>My role</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      I joined the team in the summer of 2018, when bonify was reassessing its
      vision, mission and values. With planned expansion and targeting a wider
      audience, it became important for the product itself to be improved in
      order to convey the intended message and deliver a better overall user
      experience.
      <br />
      <br />
      As the only UX/UI designer in the company, I started from scratch and was responsible
      for all the stages of the redesign process.

  <ColumnHeading>Process</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      Based on the information from analytics, as well as user surveys and
      feedback collected by Customer Support agents, it was known that:
      <br />
      <br />– Majority of the users belong to the 25-44 age group (62%).
      <br />
      <br />– Their interest vary, but value shopping, technology and real
      estate seem to pop up a lot.
      <br />
      <br />– 68% visit bonify website and web app from their mobile phone (vs
      29% desktop users).
      <br />
      <br />– Most new users report finding out about bonify when searching for
      related financial topics (eg. SCHUFA score).
      <br />
      <br />
      Basic requirements for the end user:
      <br />
      <br />– Mobile first/responsive.
      <br />
      <br />– In line with the current style on the web.
      <br />
      <br />– Professional and straightforward when it comes to look, feel and interaction.
      <br />
      <br />– Age-appropriate (Professor Score felt too “junior” to our users).

  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      Templates for the new CMS needed to be designed according to needs and
      requirements of the content team (Marketing department) who’d be
      maintaining that part of the website. Additionally, the number one value
      Marketing team wished for to be reflected in the new design was
      trustworthiness. All of this led us to the following basic requirements
      for the Marketing team:
      <br />
      <br />– Component-based design for templates to ensure flexibility.
      <br />
      <br />– Simple and clean design to put content in the spotlight.
      <br />
      <br />– “Good quality” look and feel, using patterns familiar to users.
      <br />
      <br />– AMP-compliant – due to importance of organic traffic to the
      website (±40%).
      <br />
      <br />
      Main goals: reduce bounce rate, improve engagement (session duration/pages
      per visit).

  <ColumnHeading>Research “competition”</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      Although bonify doesn’t have a direct competitor on the German market, I
      looked into a number of successful companies worldwide who exist in a
      similar financial/credit scoring space. This helped to set up a design
      benchmark for new bonify.

  <ColumnHeading>Start building a design language</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      Keeping all the initial requirements and intentions in mind, I started
      defining very basic rules and building blocks for the new bonify style
      guide. I wanted to include rules to follow not only for myself, but also
      for everyone who’d end up generating any visual content for the website
      (eg. photos, illustration). After adding guidelines for verbal
      communication which came from Marketing, altogether it produced the bonify
      brand book, which was printed with copies distributed to everyone in the
      company – to keep everyone on the same page.

  <ColumnHeading>Define structure and interactions</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      Together with the Content Manager, we had multiple brainstorming sessions
      to discuss detailed requirements for each template, with each resulting in
      producing simple wireframes in Balsamiq. When possible, these were filled
      with real content – unfortunately, this was not always possible. Designing
      without knowing exact content is difficult, so for certain elements we had
      to agree on some basic rules to follow, eg. the length of excerpt visible
      on Article preview cards. During reviews, I had to often remind everyone
      about the importance of thinking mobile first (“What about mobile?” became
      my catchphrase) – being used to ubiquity of 2- and 3-column layouts on
      news portals, Content Manager would initially want to apply them
      everywhere.
      <br />
      <br />
      The changes spanned not only layouts, but also section labels and overall information
      architecture.

  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      To verify if our first ideas would work and how users would navigate the
      new website, I shared some of the simple wireframes with our Beta testers,
      asking them specific questions (eg. “Where would you go to read articles
      about loans? “What kind of information do you expect on a page like
      this?”). Only after getting positive feedback on these issues, I moved to
      fleshing out designs in higher fidelity.

    Apply visual design and start handing over for development
  </ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      Equipped with the visual guidelines prepared earlier in the style guide, I
      started putting everything together and building high fidelity screens for
      further use. Overall, I designed and “constructed” around 20
      purpose-specific templates.
      <br />
      <br />
      These spanned from intended to be more “hard-coded” (like a homepage, where
      content doesn’t change very often), to the ones requiring much more flexibility,
      like templates for article/blog posts.
      <br />
      <br />
      The latter posed the biggest challenge, of course – designing for the
      unknown future content is not an easy task. Together with the developers
      for this project, we tried to consider different scenarios and put some
      system limitations in place. All of this to avoid the layouts “breaking”
      when eg. the headline is too long.
      <br />
      <br />
      Working with developers was also very important for making sure all the components
      and behaviours were AMP-compliant and brainstorming feasible alternative ideas
      when that wasn’t the case. One by one, the templates were being handed over
      for development, with final kinks and compromises agreed on in the process.

  <ColumnHeading>Share with the users (again)</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      At this stage, screens were much more detailed, some with the actual
      intended content. Unfortunately, live versions were not available for
      preview (limitations of Prismic CMS in the beginning).
      <br />
      <br />
      With final mockups in store, I reached out to our users to get their feedback
      once again. Since the “brand image” and the overall aesthetic changed a lot
      at this point, the Marketing team and I were very curious about how it would
      be perceived!
      <br />
      <br />
      Lucky for us, it turned out nobody really liked Professor Score, so he
      could finally retire…
      <br />
      <br />
      More importantly, the general consensus from the users was that the new designs
      better reflected the product, its features and its main purpose.

  <ColumnHeading>Release!</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      What was left was to release, watch the metrics and listen to incoming
      feedback.
      <br />
      <br />
      It was a huge release due to the system switch (from WordPress to Prismic)
      and a lot of things could’ve gone wrong. System did give up at the end of the
      release day (February 22) and rollback was necessary. New website went live
      again on February 26, and keeping those two dates in mind, it’s interesting
      to look at some of the metrics.

  <ColumnHeading>Reflect and think about the future</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      Under a broad label of “bonify redesign”, there are many more updates to
      come for the rest of the ecosystem.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the meantime, a lot of smaller (and something a little bit bigger) visual
      bugs are still being fixed in the new CMS system.
      <br />
      <br />
      Overall, completing this project provided a huge boost of morale to the
      entire team AND improved the numbers.
      <br />
      <br />
      Content team is happy with the system set in place, and together we’re currently
      defining improvements to eg. landing page templates.
      <br />
      <br />
      Meanwhile, visitors to the bonify website feel more encouraged to explore
      and read the content. This improved engagement is slowly translating into
      increasing the number of registrations.
      <br />
      <br />
      While doing so, they enter the bonify apps – together with the Product team,
      we’re currently working on rethinking and redesigning that area.
