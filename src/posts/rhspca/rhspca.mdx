    <p>
      Rockingham-Harrisonburg SPCA is an animal shelter based in the USA, with a
      strong mission. Apart from taking care of animals, it's also involved in
      regular community outreach activities, as well as education.

  <ColumnHeading>Starting point</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      Rockingham-Harrisonburg SPCA needed help with performing an{" "}
      <strong>audit</strong> of their current website, alongside providing{" "}
      <strong>recommendations for improvements</strong>. RHSPCA is a
      well-established organisation, helping its local community and engaging
      with it through the social media. The website itself (code, structure)
      hadn't been fundamentally updated since 2007. The main{" "}
      <strong>goal</strong> was to provide RHSPCA with clear guidelines which
      would help them to build a more user-friendly website, better for their
      visitors and members of staff in charge of its maintenance.
      <br />I followed Joe Natoli's UX Audit Cheat Sheet as a general guide for the
      auditing process. It revealed a number of issues related to presentation and
      content itself.

  <ColumnHeading>Main issues identified by the audit</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      - Website was unresponsive and difficult to interact with on devices with
      smaller viewports.
      <br />- Navigation and labelling were inconsistent.
      <br />- Specific information was difficult to locate.
      <br />- No search function was provided.
      <br />- Code was messy and tables were used to organise content.
      <br />- Visual hierarchy could have been better.
      <br />- Large blocks of written content with no subheadings and formatting
      were difficult to scan and read.
      <br />- No alt tags for images and videos.
      <br />- There were broken links and sections without content.
      <br />- No sitemap was provided for search engines.

  <ColumnHeading>Content and users</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      I followed up by creating <strong>content inventory spreadsheet</strong>{" "}
      to establish connections between different sections and locate main
      problem areas. <strong>Closed card sorting</strong> was employed, to help
      with reorganising existing content into fewer categories. It resulted in
      creating basic foundations for the structure users could understand and
      navigate better.
      <br />
      At the same time, I needed to find out the main reasons which brought
      people to RHSPCA in order to establish <strong>
        user needs
      </strong> and <strong>goals</strong>. This information was summarised
      through <strong>personas</strong>.

  <ColumnHeading>Define site objectives</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      - To promote RHSPCA values.
      <br />- To include information relevant for the users.
      <br />- To actively encourage help (adopting, donating, volunteering).
      <br />- To present the range of services fully.

<BlogColumn>
  <ColumnHeading>Define functionality specs</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      - Include Search option to help with sifting through the content quickly.
      <br />- Break down long text entries into labelled sections and paragraphs.

  <ColumnHeading>Wireframe</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      Knowing results of card sorting, user expectations, site objectives and
      functionality specs helped to establish <strong>site structure</strong>{" "}
      and priorities for the <strong>navigation</strong>.
      <br />
      The next step was to generate <strong>wireframes</strong>.
      <br />I decided to break the navigation down into groups of three. General
      Information (About Us, F.A.Q. and Contact) belonging in the header, Action
      Group (Adopt, Volunteer and Support) taking hero component's spot, with Knowledge
      Group (Humane Education, Classes and Workshops, and Services) placed below.
      The Current Group (Events, Forms and Blog), placed above the footer, would
      include categories with regularly updated content.

  <ColumnHeading>Summary</ColumnHeading>
  <ColumnText>
    <p>
      This project was an invaluable deep dive into the world of UX for me.
      Apart from being able to apply different tools and learnings to the
      process, I've also learned how to communicate with a client and work
      remotely in an effective way (even when living in different timezones).
