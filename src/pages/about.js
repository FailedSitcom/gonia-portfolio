          I research user needs based on quantitative and qualitative feedback,
          identify the main pain points, design possible solutions from
          low-fidelity wireframes to interactive prototypes, test them with
          users and iterate based on the feedback and evolving requirements.

          I focus on usability, maintaining consistency of style, aligning to
          the guidelines and following established patterns to create
          pixel-perfect designs. My goals are interfaces which are simple,
          uncluttered and work across different devices and screen sizes.

          User-centered approach is always the starting point, but I believe
          that deep understanding of the business and key product metrics are
          crucial components for a product to be successful and sustainable.
